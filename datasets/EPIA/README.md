# EPIA

Eysenck Personality Inventory Impulsivity (EPI-A) is a real dataset originally available in the `EstCRM` package (Zopluoglu, 2015). The data capture responses of 1,033 undergraduates to the five items from the Spanish version of the EPI-A impulsivity subscale. Their responses were checks on a 112 mm line segment with two end points: almost never and almost always. Item score was defined as the~distance in mm of the check mark from the left end point (Ferrando, 2002). 

*** 
## Datasets and their variables
  * `Item 1` - `Item 5` = distance in mm on a 112 mm line segment, `0` for almost never, `112` for almost always.

*** 
## Wording of the items
 * `Item 1` = Longs for excitement
 * `Item 2` = Does not stop and think things over before doing anything
 * `Item 3` = Often shouts back when shouted at
 * `Item 4` = Likes doing things in which he/she has to act quickly
 * `Item 5` = Tends to do many things at the same time
